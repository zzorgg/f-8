### 1. Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your devices:
- Obsidian (for note-taking)
- Git (for version control and syncing)
- iSH Shell (for Git on iOS) 
- Termux (for Git on Android)

### 2. Why I Chose This Method
Initially, I used VS Code and Markdown for note-taking. Over time, I explored alternatives like Notion and Standard Notes, but they didn’t suit my workflow. Eventually, I switched to Obsidian—a simple and efficient choice.

However, I didn't want to pay for Obsidian Sync. Instead, I set up Git-based syncing for my notes, and I realized others might find this approach useful too.

### 3. Getting Started
#### Step 1: Install Obsidian
Download [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download) based on your operating system:

**Mobile:**
- iOS 
- Android 
  
**Desktop/Laptop:**
- Windows 
- macOS 
- Linux:
  - AppImage
  - Snap
  - Deb
  - Flatpak

#### Step 2: Install Git
Download [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) based on your operating system:

**Mobile:**
- **iOS**: iSH Shell (it uses Alpine Linux, so we can install Git using `apk add git`)
- **Android**: Termux (install Git using `pkg install git`)

**Desktop/Laptop:**
- [Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win)
- [macOS](https://git-scm.com/downloads/mac)
- [Linux](https://git-scm.com/downloads/linux) (I use Arch, so just `sudo pacman -S git`)

### 4. Setting Up Git-Based Syncing
#### Step 1: Create an Obsidian Vault and Initialize Git
- First, create an Obsidian vault on your primary device (e.g., your PC or Mac).
- Navigate to the vault directory and initialize a Git repository:
  ```sh
  cd /path/to/your/obsidian-vault
  git init
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial commit"
  git branch -M main
  git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
  git push -u origin main
  ```

#### Step 2: Syncing Notes on iOS
- Download and install iSH Shell.
- Inside iSH, install Git using:
  ```sh
  apk add git
  ```
- Clone your Git repository to iSH:
  ```sh
  git clone <your-github-repo-url>
  ```
- iSH creates a storage folder inside iPhone storage. Copy the cloned vault to the **Obsidian** app's folder manually.
- Whenever you update notes, pull the latest changes in iSH and copy them to the Obsidian folder again.
- Make sure to create the Obsidian vault inside **On My iPhone** location.
- Make sure you know the path of your cloned repo on iSH, mine is **/home/notes**.

#### Step 3: Syncing Notes on Android
- Open Termux and install Git:
  ```sh
  pkg install git
  ```
- Clone the repository into a convenient location:
  ```sh
  git clone <your-github-repo-url>
  ```
- Open Obsidian and set the vault location to the cloned directory.
-  Whenever you update notes, pull the latest changes.

#### Step 4: Pull Changes 
- You just need to write this command 
- ```sh
  git pull origin main
  ```

#### Step 5: Syncing Notes on Linux & Windows
- Clone the Git repository wherever you want.
  ```sh
  git clone <your-github-repo-url>
  ```
- Open Obsidian and set the vault location to the cloned directory.
- Since `.obsidian` settings are present in the repo, opening it in Obsidian will work seamlessly.
- To update and sync notes, simply pull or push changes via Git.

### 5. Conclusion
- This method allows you to sync notes across multiple devices without paying for Obsidian Sync. While it requires manual Git commands, it's a powerful and cost-effective way to maintain version-controlled, cross-device note synchronization.
- Also never push changes from mobile phones. Only use laptop or pc or mac.
- I recommend using SSH for authentication. Instead of cloning with HTTPS, use
```sh
git clone git@github.com:your-username/your-repo.git
``` 
- Set up SSH keys for secure, password-less authentication.
