## Overview

The "<u>SMART CONTACT MANAGER</u>" is a user-centric web application designed for securely storing and organizing contacts. This platform gives users the flexibility to sign up with their own login credentials or log in directly through <b>Google</b> or <b>GitHub</b> accounts for a quick, hassle-free setup. Contact information is securely stored in a database, which, upon deployment, can easily be transitioned to a more scalable cloud solution, ensuring flexibility and reliable access for users as the application grows. 
<br><br>The "<u>SMART CONTACT MANAGER</u>" aims to create an efficient, all-in-one solution for managing contacts, making it easier for users to keep track of essential information in a secure, accessible way. This platform is designed to eliminate the challenges of scattered or lost contact information by centralizing all details in one reliable system. 
<br><br>Once signed up—either by creating an account with a username and password or by logging in through <b>Google</b> or <b>GitHub</b>—users land on a personalized profile page displaying their details. From here, they can start building their contact list by adding new entries. Each contact can be viewed on the Contacts page, where users have the option to update, delete, or view more details for each entry. The system also provides pagination for easy navigation through larger lists, and a search feature allows users to quickly locate specific contacts.
<br><br>The "<u>SMART CONTACT MANAGER</u>" provides a unified, customizable platform for securely managing and accessing contacts in one place, reducing data loss and helping users stay connected to their contacts seamlessly. The "<u>SMART CONTACT MANAGER</u>" is designed to make contact management as seamless as possible, helping users stay connected by keeping their important contacts safe and easily accessible. This tool not only promotes better organization but also ensures that contact information remains secure, promoting both personal and professional connectivity in a convenient, user-friendly interface.
